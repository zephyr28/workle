# workle
Wordle clone written in Java/JavaFX

Certainly not perfect and still a work in progress. The logic for checking guesses goes further than most clones I've seen, though (ie: accounts for duplicate letters).

## Features:

- Variable to allow continuous play of random words or limit to word-of-the-day
- Custom color scheme/CSS
- AnimateFX animations
- Guess checking accounts for multiple occurences of the same letter in both the guess and the secret word
